### Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a **Fitbit**, **Nike Fuelband**, or **Jawbone Up**. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:

* Dataset: **Activity monitoring data** [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as 𝙽𝙰)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

#### Loading and preprocessing the data

*Show any code that is needed to*

1. Load the data (i.e. 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚍.𝚌𝚜𝚟())
```{r}
# Load the raw activity data
activity_raw <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
```{r}
# Transform the date attribute to an actual date format
activity_raw$date <- as.POSIXct(activity_raw$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

# Compute the weekdays from the date attribute
activity_raw <- data.frame(date=activity_raw$date, 
                           weekday=tolower(weekdays(activity_raw$date)), 
                           steps=activity_raw$steps, 
                           interval=activity_raw$interval)

# Compute the day type (weekend or weekday)
activity_raw <- cbind(activity_raw, 
                      daytype=ifelse(activity_raw$weekday == "saturday" | 
                                     activity_raw$weekday == "sunday", "weekend", 
                                     "weekday"))

# Create the final data.frame
activity <- data.frame(date=activity_raw$date, 
                       weekday=activity_raw$weekday, 
                       daytype=activity_raw$daytype, 
                       interval=activity_raw$interval,
                       steps=activity_raw$steps)

# Clear the workspace
rm(activity_raw)
```

We display the first few rows of the activity data frame:
```{r}
head(activity)
```

#### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

*For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.*

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
# Compute the total number of steps each day (NA values removed)
sum_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$date), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

# Rename the attributes
names(sum_data) <- c("date", "total")
```

We display the first few rows of the sum_data data frame:
```{r}
head(sum_data)
```

2. If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
# Compute the histogram of the total number of steps each day
hist(sum_data$total, 
     breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=2500),
     col="blue", 
     xlab="Total number of steps", 
     ylim=c(0, 20), 
     main="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day\n(NA removed)")
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(sum_data$total)
median(sum_data$total)
```

#### What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}
# Clear the workspace
rm(sum_data)

# Compute the means of steps accross all days for each interval
mean_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, 
                       by=list(activity$interval), 
                       FUN=mean, 
                       na.rm=TRUE)

# Rename the attributes
names(mean_data) <- c("interval", "mean")
```

We display the first few rows of the mean_data data frame:
```{r}
head(mean_data)
```

The time serie plot is created by the following lines of code
```{r}
# Compute the time series plot
plot(mean_data$interval, 
     mean_data$mean, 
     type="l", 
     col="blue", 
     lwd=2, 
     xlab="Interval [minutes]", 
     ylab="Average number of steps", 
     main="Time-series of the average number of steps per intervals\n(NA removed)")
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
# We find the position of the maximum mean
max_pos <- which(mean_data$mean == max(mean_data$mean))

# We lookup the value of interval at this position
max_interval <- mean_data[max_pos, 1]

# Clear the workspace
rm(max_pos, mean_data)
```

### Imputing missing values

*Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as 𝙽𝙰). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.*

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
```{r}
# Clear the workspace
rm(max_interval)

# We use the trick that a TRUE boolean value is equivalent to 1 and a FALSE to 0.
NA_count <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
```{r}
# Clear the workspace
rm(NA_count)

# Find the NA positions
na_pos <- which(is.na(activity$steps))

# Create a vector of means
mean_vec <- rep(mean(activity$steps, na.rm=TRUE), times=length(na_pos))
```

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r}
# Replace the NAs by the means
activity[na_pos, "steps"] <- mean_vec

# Clear the workspace
rm(mean_vec, na_pos)
```

We display the first few rows of the new activity data frame:
```{r}
head(activity)
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
```{r}
# Compute the total number of steps each day (NA values removed)
sum_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$date), FUN=sum)

# Rename the attributes
names(sum_data) <- c("date", "total")

# Compute the histogram of the total number of steps each day
hist(sum_data$total, 
     breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=2500),
     col="blue", 
     xlab="Total number of steps", 
     ylim=c(0, 30), 
     main="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day\n(NA replaced by mean value)")
```

The mean and median are computed like
```{r}
mean(sum_data$total)
median(sum_data$total)
```

#### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

*For this part the 𝚠𝚎𝚎𝚔𝚍𝚊𝚢𝚜() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.*

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
# The new factor variable "daytype" was already in the activity data frame
head(activity)
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
```{r}
# Clear the workspace
rm(sum_data)

# Load the lattice graphical library
library(lattice)

# Compute the average number of steps taken, averaged across all daytype variable
mean_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, 
                       by=list(activity$daytype, 
                               activity$weekday, activity$interval), mean)

# Rename the attributes
names(mean_data) <- c("daytype", "weekday", "interval", "mean")
```

We display the first few rows of the mean_data data frame:
```{r}
head(mean_data)
```

The time series plot take the following form:
```{r}
# Compute the time serie plot
xyplot(mean ~ interval | daytype, mean_data, 
       type="l", 
       lwd=1, 
       xlab="Interval", 
       ylab="Number of steps", 
       layout=c(1,2))
```
